#how to use

It is pretty easy to use, all you have to do is add a template file
Every single line other than the heading will be print normally centered
The heading will have something fancy

It is recommended that you leave spaces in between to make ti look cleaner
Also if you doing some code presentaions, you can have snippets at the top.
** IT WOULD LOOK AWESOME **

#more

Headings should start with a '#'

-- leave a line between the heading and description  --

-- increase size to make it look cool --

Add a way to input code( maybe give it background color or something )
Also have something for bold too
Spaces are also taken into consideration when centering
